# SURV-727-Term-Paper
Final research project and paper for SURV 727. All R code and relevant input files can be found here.

Download mask_tweets.RData, tweets_state.RData, and covid19_vaccinations_in_the_united_states.csv into your local directory. These are the three input files needed to run the R code for this program. Update the "load" commands in the initial setup to match the file locations for your download.

A valid Google key is needed to run this program as well, as the Google API is used for some of the geocoding tasks.
